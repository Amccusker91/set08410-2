	<h1>A Brief Summary</h1>
	 <p>Firstly, it is best to introduce myself. My name is Andrew McCusker and I am currently on Year 2 of a BEng (Hons) Cyber Security Graduate Apprenticeship where I work full time for a company called ID Cyber Solutions as a Cyber Security Analyst and study one day a week at university.
		Going back, I have recently transitioned over into the Cyber Security industry after spending over 10 years as a Technical Engineer including 6 years in the British Army where I was a Weapon System Engineer. I have always had a keen interest in Cyber Security and I hope to 
		contribute into the brilliant industry.</p>
