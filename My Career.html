		<h1> Cyber Security </h1>
		<p> After spending over 10 years in the engineering industry, with 6 being in the British Army. I decided it was time for
            me to transition over into the Cyber world. I started by quitting my job and enrolling on an HNC Cyber Security Degree.
            It was clear that was the best decision I had made in years. Following successfully completing my HNC, I gained a invaluble
            BEng (Hons) Cyber Security Graduate Apprentice with a company called <a href="https://idcybersolutions.com/">ID Cyber Solutions.</a>
            and studying at <a href="https://www.napier.ac.uk/">Edinburgh Napier University.</a>

            My short 6 months at <a href="https://idcybersolutions.com/">ID Cyber Solutions.</a> I have became a Certified Cyber Essentials Assessor and recently just passed my Certifed Ethical
            Hackers course</p>
